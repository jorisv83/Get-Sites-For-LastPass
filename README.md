Introduction
============

This program will retrieve all the different shop URLs from the CoolBlue website and put them in a comma separated list.
This list can be easily used in LastPass' "equivalent domains" settings.

The result can also be viewed here: http://pastebin.com/SEfqTJ9d

Usage
=====

Make sure the URL is correct and push the "GO!!!" button. 
When done the field on the right hand side will contain all the domains the program found.

The "copy to clipboard" button will copy the text in the textbox to the clipboard so you can easily paste this in the LastPass option screen.
